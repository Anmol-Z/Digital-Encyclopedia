Description:

The planet Mars is situated further from the Sun than the other three terrestrial planets of the so-
lar system. It is almost 10 times less massive than the Earth and Venus,but has about twice the mass
of Mercurcy. Like the other terrestrial planets, Mars formed hot and quickly differentiated into three
different reservoirs: an iron core, a silicate mantle, and a silicate crust. 
Althou heat is constantly generated inside its mantle and crust by the decay of radioactive isotopes, 
Mars slowly cooled over the last 4 Gyr. Mars is a cold desert world.It is half the size of Earth.Mars
is sometimes called the Red Planet. It's red because of rusty iron in the ground.Like Earth,Mars has
seasons, polar ice caps, volcanoes, canyons and weather. It has a very thin atmosphere made of carbon 
dioxide, nitrogen, and argon. There are signs of ancient floods on Mars,  but now water mostly exists 
in icy dirt and thin clouds.On some Martian hillsides, there is evidence of liquid salty water in the
ground.
